# Build

## Java

### Use Maven/Gradle Wrapper

By using [Maven Wrapper](https://github.com/takari/maven-wrapper) or [Gradle Wrapper](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html)
the build process is encapsulated and provided by the project.

Using these tools obsoletes the need to have Maven or Gradle installed on your machine or on the build server.
The correct version of the build tool will automatically be downloaded as a Java JAR artifact.
